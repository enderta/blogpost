# Blogpost App

This is a full-stack application that uses MongoDB for the database, GraphQL for the API, and React for the front-end.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store our data.
- GraphQL: A query language for APIs used to fetch and mutate our data.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enderta/blogpost.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the server:

```bash
cd server
node app.js
```
4. Start the client:

```bash
cd src
npm start
```
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

6. for the database, you can use MongoDB Atlas or MongoDB Compass to connect to the database.

7. for the GraphQL, you can use GraphQL Playground to test the queries and mutations.
